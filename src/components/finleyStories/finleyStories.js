        A project I made as a result of something my mom said which started my
        mind turning.
      </p>
      <p className="finleyText">
        My brother at the start of lockdown brought a Tonies box (this is a
        device which allows sounds to be recorded and played through a figure
        placed on top). My brother brought this as a way for distance family to
        be in touch with my nephew as he grows, so my family could record them
        telling stories and then play them for him.
      </p>
      <p className="finleyText">
        My mother made the comment about wanting to do video stories and I
        thought "If only there was somewhere to put them. I know I could try and
        make one."
