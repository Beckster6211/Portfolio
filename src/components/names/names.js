          <summary>Beckster </summary>
          <p class="text">
            The story of Beckster, is from my cousin, as he was growing up had a
            speech impediment and couldn't say 'Becky', not sure why it's quite
            easy... so he would call me 'Becks', that got morphed into
            'Beckster' its actually got morphed more than that to the point
            where my uncle has been know to call 'Sophie' and I've answered.
            (Sophie Ellis-Bextor, thats okay I'm not going to murder him on the
            dancefloor).

          <p class="text">
            I have always loved Nintendo products prefer handheld consoles to on
            the television, I have two brothers who are gamers one older (who
            favours PlayStation) and one younger (who favours Xbox), they have
            conversations about graphics and processors etc and I just nod
            along. (They always laugh that my responseis 'I like Mario').
            <br></br>

            The story behind the name Nintendogirl is actually from the security
            guard at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Cancer Care building. My dad
            had prostrate cancer and had to undergo radiotheraphy as his
            treatment, this involved being at the QE everyday for weeks. To keep
            myself entertained during this time I was playing my 3DS the
            security guard every morning (during his rounds) would stop and chat
            with me about games. During my dads treatment it was my birthday and
            the whole family got me a Nintendo Switch (something I had been
            talking about saving for). So for the remainder of my dads treatment
            I would be playing my Nintendo switch. The security guard would
            still stop during his rounds and we talk about the games I could get
            and he would even have a Mario Kart race with me (he was quite
            good).
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            He would greet me every morning walking into the building with
            'Morning Nintendogirl' and I would response with 'Morning Security
            guard' (I wish I knew his name).

            Sometimes my older brother just simplifies my name to just B. I
            still respond.
