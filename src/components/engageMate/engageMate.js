      <p className="engageMateText">
        Final project we had was to look at improving the remote teaching
        delivery. We were placed into groups of six and we were given a month to
        tackle this problem. We created EngageMate to help encourage engagement
        and participation, as you donâ€™t get the same live feedback and reception
        that would in real time, making it difficult to gauge audience
        understanding.
