          One of the things that I love is cartoons and animation. I have always
          like them, I use to watch old school Tom and Jerry with my dad
          (classic Tom and Jerry, Fred Quimby era) Now that I am older I enjoy
          the intricacies of it. The time, the effort, the energy that goes into
          making just one second of what you see on screen. I like all kinds on
          animation and have favourites of each kind:

            Sumptuous stop motion: new styles of animation like Stop motion but
            instead of physically having to move models models are moved
            electronically, its like all of the above combined together.

        <p className="text">
          Something I collect is The Beano annual.
          <br></br>
          It started 2004 ish? as my dad would buy the Beano annual for me for
          Christmas(for me, yeah right) but I did start to like them and it got
          to be a recurring thing and the collection developed.
          <br></br>
          When I was at a carboot sale with my mom, stepdad and little brother
          saw some of the older years (mid 90s) on someones stall and brought
          them. Realised that I nearly had my age in Beanos (1992 - to the
          current year) and thought that would be a nice to have and requested
          them.
          <br></br>
          My family now keep an eye out for them in charity shops and carboots
          etc and I now have consecutively from 1979 to present year and
          growing.
          <br></br>
          My favourite from the Beano is The Numskulls, it's about Brainy,
          Blinky, Radar, Snitch and Cruncher that live in Edd's Head and control
          what he does, says, think, feels. I like it because I use to think
          that is how everything works, when I was little and before you learn
          about electricity, blood cells and all that boring stuff.

        <summary class="subHeading">Rugby Union</summary>
        <p className="text">
          I have become a fan rugby union. Started as my cousin started playing
          rugby for his local team (Camp Hill) and we would go and watch to
          support him. I would have <strong>no idea</strong> what I would be
          watching (so thought I should learn this sport). Started watching the
          sport to understand it and I've grown to enjoy it.
          <br></br>
          My local team is the Wasp.
